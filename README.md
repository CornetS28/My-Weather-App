# My-Weather-App

- This project is about creating a dynamic weather App with Javascript using ES6 modules, HtML, CSS and webpack. It is part of the courses of The Odin Project.
<br>

- To build this project, I have used the weather forecast site [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)
<br>
